# Development Diary

## Goal: no vertical duplication

Referring to [instructional document](https://www.dj4e.com/assn/dj4e_model.md).

- What we have in csv file:

`âœ…name,âœ…description,âœ…justification,âœ…year,âœ…longitude,âœ…latitude,âœ…area_hectares,âœ…category,âœ…states,âœ…region,âœ…iso`

*`iso` means ISO country code. E.g., country: Algeria, ISO country code: dz.
*`justification` - justification to become a world heritage?
*`state` is actually country.

## Data Model

- [x] After we designed our schema, it's time to implement `models.py`. ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

- [x] When finish the data model, `makemigration` and `migrate`.

## Read CSV File

- The instructor uses Python's CSV module, but pandas is more powerful.
- [ ] Data sanitizing: develop a policy. e.g.Check format, e.g. year complies integer format. If not, drop such that database will store as `null`.
    - Numerical: if empty or invalid format -> Null; else parse as integer or float
        - Integer: `year, `
        - Float: `longitude, latitude, area_hectares`
    - Text: always leave it as-is.
        - `name, description, justification`
    - Special Text as identity: if empty, we want null instead of empty. But again - this can be done in post data processing. At this point we can just leave it as-is.
        - `category, state, region, iso`

## Load in database

- [ ] The script: either use a plain python file, or use Django's script integrated with `./manage.py` (recommended).
- [ ] Make the script wipe out database everytime it is load, better for debugging.
- Big idea: flat data --> structured data.
    - [ ] You'll probably read in row by row using a for loop. Then, write to the database, considering foreign key relationships. 
    - (The instruction has an example using `Membership`, but that's likely because a Many to Many field is used. If we're not using that, we probably don't need `Membership`)
- [ ] Run and fix the script until the result looks correct.
- Additional tooling - if you need to check out database manually, you can use sqlite cli tools, as described in instruction.

**Useful Tips on Database**

- Reset all table content (but not schema): `./manage.py flush`
- Reset all table and schema: `delete migrations/ folder in that app`, `delete database file` and `./manage.py makemigrations your_django_app_name`. Finally `./manage.py migrate`. You're now brand new, both table and schema.
    - Create superuser if needed.

## You are very close: upload your database `sqlite` to autograder

The autograder only looks at the database. Make sure this final outcome is right.
